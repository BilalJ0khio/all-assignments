    <h1>Why we need to boycott <em>Israeli products</em></h1>
    <p>
      The boycott of <em>Israeli products</em> in response to the Palestine
      genocide situation is a moral stance against <strong>injustice</strong>.
      <b
        >It symbolizes solidarity with the Palestinian people, who endure
        oppression, displacement, and violence</b
      >. By boycotting Israeli goods, individuals and organizations globally aim
      to pressure Israel to end its occupation and human rights violations in
      Palestine. Economic sanctions serve as a non-violent means to advocate for
      justice, demanding accountability from the international community. Such
      actions highlight the power of collective activism and aim to promote
      peace, equality, and respect for human rights in the region, fostering
      hope for a just resolution to the conflict.

      Israel has killed over 21,000 Palestinians since October 7, 2023. This
      includes a huge number of children and women. Most of the people killed in
      this war are civilians, including journalists. Israel blames Hamas for its
      recent genocide in the Gaza Strip. However, many, including UN
      Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, hold that the Hamas attacks did not
      happen in isolation, as they were the result of decades of oppression and
      occupation.

    <p>
      Israel&apos;s technological advancement, its support by the United States
      and some other European nations, disharmony among the Muslim states, and
      its weak military strength have coerced the pro-Palestinian people to look
      for other means to stop Israel&apos;s atrocities.
